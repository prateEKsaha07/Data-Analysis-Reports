📊 Day 1 Dashboard Task (Sales Performance Dashboard)
Imagine you’re a junior data analyst at a retail company. Your manager wants a dashboard to understand sales performance.

🎯 Objective
Build a Sales Performance Dashboard that answers:

How are total sales and profit performing?

Which regions and products are driving revenue?

Which customer segment is most profitable?

✅ What your dashboard should include
1. KPI Cards (Top Section)
Create cards for:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Profit Margin (%) = Profit / Sales

Total Orders

2. Sales Trend Over Time
📈 Line chart:

Axis → OrderDate (month-wise)

Values → Sales

Goal: Show monthly sales trend.

3. Regional Performance
📊 Bar or column chart:

Axis → Region

Values → Sales and Profit

Goal: Compare regions.

4. Product Analysis
📦 Bar chart:

Axis → Product

Values → Sales

Sort descending to find top-selling products.

5. Customer Segment Insights
🥧 Pie or donut chart:

Legend → CustomerSegment

Values → Profit

6. Filters (Very important — job-style)
Add slicers for:

Region

Category

CustomerSegment

Date range

⭐ Bonus (If you want to go pro)
Try:

A Top 5 Products visual

Drill-through page for product details

Conditional formatting on profit

When you finish:

👉 Tell me what insights you found (like a real analyst would).
Tomorrow I’ll give you Day 2 dataset with a harder business scenario (marketing or finance style).

If you want, I can also:

✅ Review your dashboard design
✅ Suggest improvements
✅ Give interview-style questions based on it
