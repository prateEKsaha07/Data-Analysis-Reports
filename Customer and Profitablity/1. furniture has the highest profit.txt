1. furniture has the highest profit in all the other segments or categories with it 

2.home office has the higest profit margin while most of the profits are made by electronics and office supplies 

3.its ard say because its alays fluctuating all the time but if asking about current situation its not gaining a huge noticable profit but also not going on loss either

3.top customers are on the chart but customer number 98 ,20 and 6 are top 3 if we are talking about top 3

4.for suggestion i can say we should focus on home office segment as it gave us a stedy profit margin along wth revenue and take some initiative with east and south region as they gave us profit even if little but can be increased with aggressive ad campaignswhile west and north a simply unpredictable it can be risky
