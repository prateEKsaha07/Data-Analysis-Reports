🚀 Day 5 Project: Customer & Profitability Deep Dive

Yesterday was executive overview.
Today = Why are we making (or losing) money?

This adds analytical depth.

🎯 Objective

Build a Customer Profitability & Segmentation Dashboard

Instead of just revenue, we answer:

Which customers generate the most profit?

Are high-revenue customers always profitable?

Which segments are risky?

Where should the company focus retention?

That’s REAL business analytics.

📊 What To Build (Layout Structure)
🔝 Top KPI Cards

Total Customers

Total Revenue

Total Profit

Avg Profit per Customer

Customer Retention % (if data allows)

📈 Visual 1 – Top 10 Customers by Profit

Bar Chart
→ Sort descending
→ Highlight top performers

Insight: Who drives margin?

📉 Visual 2 – Revenue vs Profit Scatter Plot

X-axis: Revenue
Y-axis: Profit
Legend: Customer Segment

This shows:

High revenue, low profit customers (danger zone)

High profit, low revenue customers (growth opportunity)

📊 Visual 3 – Profit by Customer Segment

Clustered bar chart:

Consumer

Corporate

Home Office

📊 Visual 4 – Discount Impact on Profit

Line or column:
Discount vs Profit

This is strong business thinking:

Are we discounting too much and killing margin?

🎨 DAY 5 DESIGN STYLE (Different from Day 4)

We go DARK professional theme today.

🎨 Color Palette (Modern Corporate Dark)

Primary: Deep Navy → #1E2A38
Secondary: Electric Blue → #3A86FF
Accent: Emerald → #2ECC71
Warning: Soft Red → #E63946
Background: Dark Gray → #121212

🎨 Where To Use Colors

Primary (Navy):

KPI titles

Chart headers

Electric Blue:

Revenue bars

Emerald:

Profit bars

Soft Red:

Negative profit or low margin areas

Background:

Page background dark

Cards slightly lighter grey

🧠 Advanced Touch (Resume Booster)

Add:

🔹 Profit Margin Measure
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit],[Total Revenue])

🔹 Customer Ranking Measure
Customer Rank = RANKX(ALL(Customer), [Total Profit], , DESC)


That makes you look like someone who understands DAX logic.

🏆 Resume Line After This Project

Developed a Customer Profitability & Segmentation Dashboard in Power BI analyzing revenue-profit relationships, discount impact, and customer ranking using DAX measures.

That sounds professional.

📈 Why This Project Is Stronger

Yesterday = descriptive analytics
Today = diagnostic analytics

Recruiters LOVE that jump.

🔥 Challenge Mode (Optional)

Add a slicer:

Segment

Region

Discount range

Make it interactive.

You’re halfway through your 10-day sprint.

Day 1–3: Basics
Day 4: Executive Dashboard
Day 5: Analytical Depth

Now you’re entering serious territory.

Before you start building — tell me:

Do you have:

Customer ID column?

Segment column?

Discount column?

If yes, we go full power mode. 🚀

and where is data are files

Good question. 👌
For Day 5, you’ll use the same dataset you used for Day 4 (the executive dashboard one).

You do NOT need a new file.

✅ Use the Same Dataset If It Has:

Check your fields panel. If you see:

Customer Name or Customer ID

Segment (Consumer / Corporate / Home Office)

Sales or Revenue

Profit

Discount

Region

Then you’re fully ready for Day 5.

Most likely you’re using a Superstore-style dataset — it already contains all of this.

🔎 If You Don’t Have Customer Data

If your current dataset does NOT have:

Customer column

Segment column

Discount column

Then tell me and I’ll generate a clean CSV file for Day 5 that you can directly import into Power BI.

📁 Where Your Current File Is

From earlier, you had:

day4_executive_dashboard.csv

That’s your dataset file.
You can reuse it.

If you don’t see customer-related columns inside it, open Power Query and confirm.
