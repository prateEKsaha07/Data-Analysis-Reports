1. i choose dask theme for dash board because it helps in keeping the dash board and can highlight the important points more and also reduces eye strain and kind of look asthetic too

2.i kept the kpis on top because those are the main points or i should say values any member of the meeting would like to see before any thing else and can help in further analysis too

3. if revenue grows and profit doesn't then it mean we should limit the expences on other categories like ads or profits or offers have to find something which can attract customers and also maintain our profits too

4.the course of action accouding to me should be that we should focus on our top performing segment as it can ensure an steady flow around the product segment
