so hi everyone this my report n profitability performance analysis if this this year till June 2025 for starters we should talk about and revenue is steady and company is doing really well its has a 300k revenue on each region with a steady profit matgin with more than 25% on each region although there was a drop in profit from last month which was 61k to 60k this month but the revenue is increasing from last 2 months on last month we had a profit margin o 25.35% and this month we have 25.01% which might be because of the decrese in avg discount 14.96 to 14.54 our ost profitable region is east and lowest perfoming region is west with profit margin of 24.38 and if we dont compare it with other region its a health number to be at .and in matter of is discount hurting profits no not right but we can see that the gap between profit and revenue is decresing it might not hurt things right now but we are talking about future it might create a problem if we cant increase our revenue from every region
we should invest on east as has the higest profit margin in all the other regions and on west even if it had the losedt profit margin still it showed an rapid increase in profits and revenue in last month and the we should focus on south the most stable region on all region from like around January on revenue not in profits and we can increase the profit and stabilize the flow with some targeted discounts that will save us from cost of universal discounts on product brecause it might not work on every region and also it will help if we can cut some cost in the manufacturing and trafportation level if we want to go higher in profit margins asap and yeah our most  popular category in every region is office supplies on east, furnitures on north,electronics on south and west it is furnitures again and we should focus on rapid manufacturing of furnitures to meet the inventory requirement of two regions because it can sold out preety quickly and that is it.

the biggest risk to the company for right now could be decresing or incresing the discounts with out understanding targeted audience and also not making uo with the inventory requirement of the most sold items from each region as they are the key drivers of profits in every region and segments perticularlt in home office segment
