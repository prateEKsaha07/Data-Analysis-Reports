Good — Day 4 is where we level up. This one is resume-tier if you build it clean.

I made your dataset here:

👉 Download Day 4 dataset

🔥 Day 4 — Executive Dashboard Task
(Think: CEO wants a 10-second overview of the business)

You’re building this in Microsoft Power BI.

🎨 Mandatory color palette (use this)
Executive Clean Theme

Background: #F9FAFB

Primary: #1F3A8A

Secondary: #3B82F6

Accent (Profit): #10B981

Text: #111827

👉 Don’t improvise colors today. Follow this strictly.

🧱 Layout blueprint (copy this structure)
Page name: Executive Overview
Top row — KPI cards
Create 4 cards:

Total Revenue

Total Profit

Profit Margin %

Average Daily Revenue

Middle row
Left: Revenue Trend (Line chart)
Axis → Date

Values → Revenue

👉 Shows growth over time

Right: Revenue by Region (Bar chart)
Axis → Region

Values → Revenue

👉 Shows geographic performance

Bottom row
Left: Category Performance (Stacked bar)
Axis → Category

Values → Revenue & Profit

👉 Compare product performance

Right: Profit vs Revenue Scatter
X → Revenue

Y → Profit

Legend → Region

👉 Shows efficiency

Filters (top or left side only)
Add slicers:

Date range

Region

Category

👉 Use dropdown style slicers (no big button walls)

📊 Business questions you must answer
After building, you should be able to answer:

Is revenue trending up or down?

Which region drives the most revenue?

Which category is most profitable?

Are high-revenue regions also high-profit?

Where should leadership focus growth?

You’ll explain these like a business analyst.

⭐ Extra challenge (resume booster)
If you want advanced points:

👉 Add a Profit Margin by Region chart
👉 Add conditional formatting (green = good, red = bad)
